# CSGOanalysis

## Project Goal
This project main goal is to better understand CS:GO professionnal matches. With 3 datasets (players, matches and teams),
we will try answer different questions :

- Are statistics enough to categorize a player ? (clustering)
- Can we build a model to predict the winner of a CS:GO match ?

## Couter-Strike:GlobalOffensive
CS:GO is a video-game that pits two 5-players teams against each other, the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorist (Ts and CTs). 
In the main game mode (the one that we are interested in for professionnal CS:GO), both sides are tasked with eliminating the
other while completing separate objectives. The Terrorists must plant the bomb (on one of two sites) and defend it until it
detonates, the Counter-Terrorists must either prevent the bomb from being planted or defuse the bomb.

## Data sources
All the data has been scraped from the hltv.org website :

"Welcome to the leading CS:GO site in the world, featuring news, demos, pictures, 
statistics, on-site coverage and much much more!"

**I will not release the scraper code or the database.**
